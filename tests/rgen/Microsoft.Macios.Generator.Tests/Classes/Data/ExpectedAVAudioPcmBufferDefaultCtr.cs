	///     <para>
	///         This constructor should be called by derived classes when they completely construct the object in managed code and merely want the runtime to allocate and initialize the <see cref="Foundation.NSObject" />.
	///         This is required to implement the two-step initialization process that Objective-C uses, the first step is to perform the object allocation, the second step is to initialize the object.
	///         When developers invoke this constructor, they take advantage of a direct path that goes all the way up to <see cref="Foundation.NSObject" /> to merely allocate the object's memory and bind the Objective-C and C# objects together.
	///         The actual initialization of the object is up to the developer.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         This constructor is typically used by the binding generator to allocate the object, but prevent the actual initialization to take place.
	///         Once the allocation has taken place, the constructor has to initialize the object.
	///         With constructors generated by the binding generator this means that it manually invokes one of the "init" methods to initialize the object.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>It is the developer's responsibility to completely initialize the object if they chain up using this constructor chain.</para>
	///     <para>
	///         In general, if the developer's constructor invokes the corresponding base implementation, then it should also call an Objective-C init method.
	///         If this is not the case, developers should instead chain to the proper constructor in their class.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         The argument value is ignored and merely ensures that the only code that is executed is the construction phase is the basic <see cref="Foundation.NSObject" /> allocation and runtime type registration.
	///         Typically the chaining would look like this:

	///     <example>

	/// //
	/// // The NSObjectFlag constructor merely allocates the object and registers the C# class with the Objective-C runtime if necessary.
