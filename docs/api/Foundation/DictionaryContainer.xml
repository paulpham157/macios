	When creating a strongly-typed wrapper for NSDictionary,
	subclass the DicionaryContainer and provide two constructors:
	one taking an NSDictionary (to create the wrapper) and one
	taking no arguments, which should call the base class with an
	NSMutableDictionary.  Then use one of the various Get and Set
	methods exposed by this class to get and set values.  This is
	how a sample class would work:

    <summary>Convenience base class used by strongly-typed classes that wrap NSDictionary-based settings.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	Many iOS and OSX APIs accept configuration options as untyped
	NSDictionary values, or return untyped NSDictionary values.
	The C# bindings offer strong-typed versions of those
	dictionaries, which allow developers to get code completion
	while passing parameters, and to extract data from return
	values.  The DicionaryContainer is an abstract base class that
	encapsulates the common code to wrap NSDictionaries like this.
